The main data sets are available for download at the official government website: data.medicare.gov. The data set of interest to us is the Hospital Compare data. This data set is updated several times per year. Private hospital owners and local county governments are always very much interested in this data set, as a major source of their revenue depends on meeting the criteria. Since hundreds of billions of dollars of government payouts are based on this dataset, it is widely studied, and there are numerous consultants and consulting businesses built around this dataset. Most data science shops associated with hospitals routinely analyze this data set.
