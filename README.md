The US government has two main single-payer, national social insurance programs. Medicare is for seniors
who are age 65 and older who paid into the Medicare system when working (or their spouses paid into the
system), and also for persons eligible for disability. Medicaid is for those who are indigent, and also for seniors
who never worked and did not pay into the Medicare system (or did not have a spouse who paid into the system).

In the US, most hospitals are private, and private hospitals can be for profit or not for profit. Some hospitals
are public, owned by a local county government, and often referred to as a “county hospital.” Few counties
have more than one hospital. Most large cities have several private hospitals, a mix of for profit and not for profit.
For most hospitals, Medicare / Medicaid is a major source of revenue, and for county hospitals it is usually the
main source of revenue. Medicare/ Medicaid has standards that hospitals must meet. Some payments are
withheld if standards are not met. Some payments are bonuses if standards are exceeded.

The main data sets are available for download at the official government website: data.medicare.gov. The
data set of interest to us is the Hospital Compare data. This data set is updated several times per year.
Private hospital owners and local county governments are always very much interested in this data set, as a
major source of their revenue depends on meeting the criteria. Since hundreds of billions of dollars of
government payouts are based on this dataset, it is widely studied, and there are numerous consultants and
consulting businesses built around this dataset. Most data science shops associated with hospitals routinely
analyze this data set. 

Big Data is often described in terms of the 3 V’s: Volume, Variety, and Velocity. In this assignment, we will
focus on Variety.
